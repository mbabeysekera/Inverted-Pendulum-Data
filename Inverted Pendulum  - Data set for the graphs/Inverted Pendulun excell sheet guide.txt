following shows the table guide for the tables in excell sheet.

table 1 - Figure7: The graph of Error vs. sampling time when KP = 18, KI = 0 & KD = 0 
          and all linear PID constant are zero

table 2 - Figure 8: The graph of Error vs. sampling time when KP = 18, KI = 0 & KD = 50 
          and all linear PID constant are zero

table 3 - Figure 9: The graph of Error vs. sampling time when KP = 18, KI = 0.05 & KD = 50 
          and all linear PID constant are zero

table 4 - Figure 10: The graph of Error vs. sampling time when KP = 18, KI = 0.05 & KD = 50 
          and Linear KP = 0.002, Linear KI = 0.0005

table 5 - Figure 11: The graph of Error vs. sampling time when KP(angle) = 1
